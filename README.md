# MediaForAll_tamuhack22
- This project was done during the 2022 TAMUhack hackathon!
- A media entertainment system was created to make entertainment more accesssible
- The project incorporates text to speech and speech to text on several types of media so that those with disabilities can enjoy
- Through the use of web scraping, expansive library usage, and some I/O, this project was achievable
- While I ran into difficulties getting the front end GUI to run properly with the backend, it was a fun short project.
